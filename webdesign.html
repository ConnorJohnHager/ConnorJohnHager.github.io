            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Tommy needed a simple, modern website to expand his tour business' reach for an older audience. With limited web development experience, he required a site that was easy for him to update independently while keeping costs low and technical maintenance minimal.</p>

            <p><b>Key Features:</b></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Clean, Accessible Design:</b> Light tan background with strategic use of Tommy's signature blue for navigation and calls-to-action. Brown headers and terracotta accents create visual hierarchy inspired by architectural materials.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Mobile Optimization:</b> Block Visibility plugin enables responsive image layouts across devices, ensuring seamless navigation and accessibility for all users.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Streamlined Client Intake:</b> Forminator plugin sends booking requests directly to Tommy's email, collecting only essential information without overwhelming clients.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Cost-Effective Solution:</b> Leveraged free plugins with a Premium WordPress plan to deliver the site for $624 (including three years of hosting and labor) versus competing quotes of $1,000+.</p>

            <p><b>Results:</b> The site launched on schedule and within budget, providing Tommy with an easy-to-manage platform that successfully serves his target demographic. The streamlined intake form simplified the booking process while the mobile-responsive design ensures accessibility across all devices.</p>

            <br class="mobile-nav">
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> As Digital Media and Web Manager for Northeastern's Education Innovation division, I managed web presence for 15 departments during a period of organizational transition. My mandate was to ensure accessibility compliance, deliver engaging content for current and prospective students and families, and maintain consistent brand standards across a diverse portfolio of sites while departments navigated staffing changes and evolving needs.</p>

            <p><b>Key Features:</b></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Website Portfolio Management:</b> Oversaw 15 departmental websites in various stages from initial creation through redesigns, audits, and strategic sunsets. Worked directly with departments to translate their needs into effective web solutions using WordPress, HTML/CSS, and plugins like TablePress, along with tools like Canva, Vimeo, and Panopto for content integration. Notable projects included initial development of the <a href="https://learning.northeastern.edu/ai/gallery/">AI Gallery</a> and restructuring NUin program information by migrating content from an external application platform to the main website.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Accessibility and Mobile Standards:</b> Established mobile accessibility testing protocols and integrated responsive design standards across all projects, ensuring compliance with digital accessibility requirements and optimal user experience across devices.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;"><b>Training, Consulting and Documentation:</b> Created comprehensive standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all managed websites and provided individualized and departmental WordPress trainings  tailored to specific needs as well as consulting. Delivered an hour-long introductory WordPress workshop for staff and co-presented at an international conference on leveraging student employees for website management and event marketing.</p>

            <p><b>Results:</b> Delivered a diverse portfolio of accessible, mobile-responsive websites that served Northeastern's global education initiatives. Established sustainable documentation and training resources that empowered departments to maintain routine content updates while I focused on larger strategic projects and technical implementations.</p>
