                <p>Hollow Knight-inspired exploration platformer featuring interconnected world design, inventory management, and diverse enemy combat encounters.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Persistent Save System:</b> JSON-based save architecture that preserves multi-variable game state across sessions in a single save file. Tracks player progression (health, currency, upgrades), inventory contents, world state (defeated enemies, collected items, unlocked map sections), and scene context (current location, last rest stop visited). 
                    Auto-saves trigger on room transitions, rest stop interactions, shop visits, and player death, while supporting manual save deletion for fresh playthroughs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Resource-Based Inventory Architecture:</b> Modular inventory system built with Godot resources that differentiates between consumables and permanent upgrades. Consumable items can be used to trigger effects (healing, fast travel) or sold for currency, while permanent items activate boolean flags in save data to grant persistent bonuses like increased max health or currency multipliers. 
                    Integrated shop system allows the shopkeeper NPC to relocate between rest stops using specific consumable items, with shop inventory dynamically updating based on owned permanent upgrades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Multi-Phase Boss Behavior:</b> State machine controlling the final boss with reactive behavior patterns that adapt to player actions and positioning. The boss enters chase state when the player is in range, transitions to attack state at close proximity, and requires strategic combat to defeat. 
                    The boss needs to be hurt three times through dodging attacks, forcing wall collisions, or landing hits to enter a vulnerable stun state where damage can be dealt. The hurt counter resets after each stun phase ends, creating a risk-reward loop that emphasizes pattern recognition and tactical positioning over direct combat.

                <p>
                    <b>Scalable Inventory Architecture:</b> Inventory and deposit systems built using ScriptableObjects to ensure maintainability and expansion. 
                    Features include stackable items, streamlined UI interactions, bulk transfer functionality, and dynamic restrictions that prevent depositing quest-critical items until objectives are completed.

                <p>
                    <b>Responsive Item Effects:</b> A context-sensitive item interaction system where items apply fixed damage or healing values based on target type, species-specific preferences, and player input. 
                    Preferred items can heal and tame wild animals, heal allied creatures, or restore player health, while non-preferred items apply damage or pass through allied targets.

                <p>
                    <b>Universal NPC Behavior System:</b> All animal NPCs operate using instances of a shared universal state machine that dynamically manages behavior execution, state transitions, combat targeting, and ally-specific behaviors such as cooperative assistance and retreat commands. 
                    Species-specific traits (such as preferred foods and health values) are handled independently of the state machine while still influencing behavior conditions.

                                    <b>Responsive Item Effects:</b> A context-sensitive item interaction system where items apply fixed damage or healing values based on target type, species-specific preferences, and player input. 
                                    Preferred items can heal and tame wild animals, heal allied creatures, or restore player health, while non-preferred items apply damage or pass through allied targets.

                                    <b>Adaptive Behavior System:</b> All animal NPCs operate using instances of a shared universal state machine that dynamically manages behavior execution, state transitions, combat targeting, and ally-specific behaviors such as cooperative assistance and retreat commands. 
                                    Species-specific traits (such as preferred foods and health values) are handled independently of the state machine while still influencing behavior conditions.
