            For this project, I collected 33 days worth of data, collecting 6 variables (date, time, reading completed in minutes, 
            reading completed in pages, sleep duration and sleep quality) once per day. I recorded the number of minutes and pages 
            read each day because it gave me two different data types to work with for each reading session, and I could also use them 
            to calculate pages read per minute in case reading efficiency was a better indicator for sleep quality. Number of minutes 
            slept was recorded to test for an alternative impact to sleep quality, and then sleep quality was recorded based on how I felt 
            waking up to test trends with the other data collected. My original data mostly had sleep quality values ranging between 2 to 3.5, 
            so these values were scaled so that 2 became 1, 2.5 became 2, etc., to fit the original five-star scale. So ultimately, a sleep 
            quality score of 1 was when I struggled to get out of bed due to either a headache or fatigue, 2 was when I struggled to get out of 
            bed without any physical impairment, 3 was when I could get out of bed without struggling, 4 was when I was when I woke up well-rested 
            and eager to start the day, and 5 would have been if I woke up excited felt physically better than average.

            <i>*Important Note: The two dates highlighted in red were considered outliers due to being my first night after flying to Canada and having 
                to sleep at friendâ€™s place without my usual night routine respectively. They do not appear in the visualization.</i>

        <p style="padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 30%;">
            After reviewing my visualization, I have noticed a positive correlation between bedtime reading and sleep quality. 
            A majority of my days without reading scored below a 3 for sleep quality (10 out of 11), while a majority of my 
            reading days scored 3 or above (17 out of 22). Using the sort filters, I can also see some other correlations, 
            such as longer sleep durations more consistently recording lower sleep quality scores, and also mostly being 
            days without reading. However, shorter sleep durations seem to correlate with better sleep quality scores, and 
            are more consistently nights where bedtime reading occurred. The greater amount of pages read also seems to have some 
            correlation with improved sleep quality scores compared to lower reading amounts. In conclusion, my hypothesis seems to be 
            supported by my data collection and could potentially find a stronger correlation between bedtime reading and 
            sleep duration with more data in the future.
