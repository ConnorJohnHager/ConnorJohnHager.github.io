                    My involvement with websites was very limited until late 2022. Since then, I've immersed myself in a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript classes, 
                    as well as leading many web development projects at Northeastern University. Discover my passion in crafting dynamic, user-centric web applications through the projects below: 
                </p>

                <h2>GEO Website & WordPress</h2>
    
                <p>
                    As the successor to the original staff members who managed the GEO Website, I assumed a leadership role in overseeing updates and initiatives for the GEO website. 
                    My responsibilities included conducting a comprehensive website audit, ensuring that all information was current and relevant. In addition, I implemented significant 
                    changes such as restructuring the navigation bar to enhance user and information accessibility.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Even after transitioning to a new position, I continue to manage the website, demonstrating my ongoing commitment to its maintenance and improvement. 
                    In my current capacity, I continue to fulfill edit requests and manage substantial update projects, drawing on my expertise to ensure the website remains a valuable resource 
                    for its users.

                <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
    
                <p>
                    I participated in 12-week crash course on HTML and CSS within my master’s program in Fall 2023, ultimately
                    finishing the course with two guided websites. This crash course not only enriched my technical proficiency 
                    but also equipped me with the ability to create impactful web experiences.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    To test the knowledge I gained through this immersive experience, I also developed this portfolio website, 
                    showcasing my projects and skills. This practical application reinforced my knowledge and further ignited my 
                    passion for crafting visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

                <h2>JavaScript & D3.js</h2>
    
                <p>
                    Simultaneously with my HTML and CSS course, I enrolled in a JavaScript class during Fall 2023 to further my web development skills. 
                    Our first project was instrumental in teaching me the implementation of Event Listeners, such as enabling the code to respond dynamically 
                    when buttons are clicked. Additionally, I gained proficiency in defining object placement on a website based on pixels and learned to draw 
                    SVG objects using the D3.js framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Taking initiative, I extended my project's scope by incorporating customization features. Users can now select different tail shapes and colors, 
                    allowing for a more personalized and unique experience. This endeavor not only showcased my ability to apply JavaScript concepts practically but also 
                    reflected my commitment to enhancing user engagement and interactivity. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For my final project in the JavaScript course, I used a variety of programming concepts that I learned throughout the semester. 
                    The project features an original design built using conditional logic, loops, and defined function parameters in conjunction with 
                    the D3 framework. I also incorporated sort functionality for my data to enhance user interactivity and analytical capabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project covers a wide spectrum of programming elements and further demonstrating the knowledge I gained about JavaScript’s functionality and dynamic behavior.
